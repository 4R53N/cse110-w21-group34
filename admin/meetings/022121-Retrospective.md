  13 Topics Voted on for Retrospect
  
## Order of discussion:
  
**Project Management**
- Feature Branches
  * Creating more issues for specific features
- Revisit design and system diagrams
- More individual/async work on features
  * Work for any specific feature should be more granular
  * Each person able to work on own time outside of live-coding
  * ie. during live sessions, one person working / others watching

## Responsive Action Plans
