With the final stretch of development in sight, our team has reconvened once more to reflect upon our past achievements and remaining areas of improvement. The images and action plans (as shown below) were documented from a live Retrium session. Keep note that these discussions took place after a 15 minute standup overview of weeks 8 and 9.

  - Functional quality before visual qu
- Tuesday: "Bug bashing!"
  - Try to break each other's code to find remaining errors
- Development practices
  - Week 9 --> great improvement
    - Extensive reviews and frequent PRs (must retain!)

# Responsive Action plans

[Link to Action Items](./RetroNotes-Part2/Retrospective2.csv)

- *Moving string literals into constants*
  - If constant file too big, can consider creating separate Strings file/folder
  - For handling "internationalization" of passed variables across all files
-------
- *Detailed reviews of each other's PRs and code*
  - Careful overview; prevent any last-minute collisions
-------
- *JSDocs*
  - Function headers/variable declarations must be reviewed to meet doc standards
-------
- *README*
  - Detailed project pipeline and installation instructions
  - Link to our JSDocs
-------
- *ADRs*
  - Each sub-group should create one for choices made / features built
    - ie. all decisions to how we are setting up our stats graph
  - Use early ADRs by Viren, Arsen, and Amy as reference
-------
- *Testing*
  - Breaking each other's code on purpose
  - To identify remaining bugs
-------
- *Development Practices*
