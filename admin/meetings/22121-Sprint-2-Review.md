## PRs and Merging
```
- Live share work on VS Code

- Start timer testing fixed
- More testing on TODO
  * Will carry over into Sprint 3
  * Finalizations in ring color transitions + fade effects

- Then merged with William's code (task completed)

- All merged with main

- Code is becoming very hefty; need to make more modular

- Overall coverage:
  * Dropped to sub 60%
  * Aiming for >75% by end of week/sprint
```

## Sprint Retrospective
```
a. Stats Page (Ved, Michael K., Josh)
- Local storage updates when user completes pomos
  * Timestamps can be converted into strings for computations/attaining actual values
- Extended goals/current challenges
  * Discussing finalized data structures to use
- Transition animations function as expected
- Works independently from timer countdown + animations

b. Complete Task Button (William)
  - Local storage implementation
  - Is now merged with main

c. Timer (Keshab, Michael B.)
  - Timer functionality is implemented
  - Works via button click (start, reset functionality)
  - Fixtures
    * Testing and PRs needed
  - Extended goals: window resizing and fading animations

d. Skeleton (Amy, Arsen)
  - Skeleton / outline has been completed
  - Open for further implementations from other groups
  - PRs needed

e. Start / Stop Button (Viren)
 - Implemented and merged with main
 - Functionality combined/merged with timer
```

## Closing Thoughts
- Great progress thus far
- MVP is complete
- Further development recommended to be test-driven
- More-efficient PRs and descriptive issues for up-to-datem, asynchronous work
