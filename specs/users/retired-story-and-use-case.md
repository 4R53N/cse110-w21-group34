## User Story
As a user, I can see my past progress or progress over time so that I don't overdo work
and get burnt out, or spend too much time taking breaks and lose focus, enjoyment, and progress.
Seeing progress over time should allow me to see the results of my efforts and gain confidence
in the process, leading to less reliance on tools like the timer and find more, continued enjoyment
in certain activities.

## Use Case
#### Goal
* To organize and track time spent towards an activity and boost confidence and focus during work.

#### Steps in achieving that goal
1. Be able to see previous progress or usage of the timer and plan usage for the current day.
2. Record and track actual usage (without manual intervention) with no implications on correct or incorrect usage.
