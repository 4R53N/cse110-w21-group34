## About
* Abe just recently retired and has the resources available to try out new things he's always wanted to do or learn. He enjoys what he does, but he still likes to see himself improve over time. He wants to be able to somehow schedule or block the time he invests in these activities so that he doesn't get tired or burnt out doing 1 thing and drop it. Instead, he is content with seeing his progress add up over time and being able to work towards some goal(s), bit-by-bit.
