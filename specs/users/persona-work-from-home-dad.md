## About
 * Bob is a software engineer at Facebook who is currently working remotely. Because he is working remotely, he isn't able to seperate his personal and work lives to where he keeps debuging and improving his software until late into the night because he tends to get distracted by his kids during the day. Bob wants to implement a policy where he will only focus on one aspect of his life at a time and he wants to do this by initially finishing his work by 5pm and then spend quality time with his family. Right now, because he has the two things mixed, he can't seem to get any quality time in either aspect because the two are always mixed in his day at the same time.
