## User Story
As a user, I can generate a report of my productivity during the day and track my progress over time. Furthermore, this allows me to stay disciplined with my time and makes sure I don't overdo the break which allows me to increase productivity with less time wasted. The app further allows me to not have to use any cognitive effort in keeping track of the time, so then all my efforts go towards my work.

## Use Case
