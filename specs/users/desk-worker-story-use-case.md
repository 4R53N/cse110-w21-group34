## User Story

My job tends to be quite tedious and repetitive. I am always filing reports and filling out written documents at a consistent pace. However, the repetition makes me feel as if I am not making any progress at all. I decide to use a pomodoro app to remind myself whenever I need to take a break so that I work at a healthy rate. I also use this app for its progression features. I like to look back at my progress that is shown on the app so that I remember how much I am achieving so that I feel the encouragement to keep moving forward.

## Use Case
```
a. Goal
  - To display reminders via the pomo timer (25 minutes + 5 minute rest)

b. Steps
```
  - User starts timer on app
  - User enters list of items as a to-do list
    * At end of 4 pomo duration (long break), user can check off completed work
  - Progress display chart (minimalistic design)
