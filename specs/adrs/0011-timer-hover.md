## Context and Problem Statement

We were deciding on whether to use click or hover for showing panes.

## Considered Options

* Click
  - Panes will come out on click
  - Panes will be closed on second click
* Hover
  - Panes will come out on hover
  - Panes will be closed off hover

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Click, because

* More intuitive for user
* Simpler design for user interaction
* Clean transition for pane to enter and exit screen

Pros and Cons of Other Options

Hover

* Pro: Gives user another viewing option
* Con: Annoying in situations where the user doesn't want to view the pane but accidentally hovers over it
* Con: Doesn't work for mobile and is less intuitive for user
