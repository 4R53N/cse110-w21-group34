# CI/CD Pipeline Status

## Phase 1

All of our build requirements are working properly. These include:
- Linting via ESLint
- Unit tests via Jest
- Report generation via Coveralls
- Interfacing reports via Coverage
- Human reviewers (2 required on each pull request)
- Documentation generation via JSDocs

Further checks include preventing any member from force-merging their commits.
